**SkyNot** is a Firefox extension that replaces Google's annoying AI-generated content with quotes from the Terminator movies.

## üé¨ What It Does

SkyNot automatically intercepts content being added to Google's 'AI Overview' container, and steps in to replace it with memorable quotes from Terminator characters, complete with avatars and typing animations.
